Currently I'm a Data Engineer @ LogicSource. Although I'd like to work at a startup, hit me up if you know of or have any opportunities open.

I am a self-taught developer interested in front-end, back-end and infrastucture. I believe in designing things with passion to solve problems correctly with usability and aesthetics in mind. Sometimes I tinker with lua and neovim, use python for data exploration and create bash scripts to automate workflows. C1 English and Native Spanish

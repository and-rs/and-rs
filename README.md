A strategic, results‑driven polyglot engineer who leverages cross‑functional synergy to deliver end‑to‑end, cloud‑native solutions that balance scalability, usability, and visual impact. Passionate about driving value through design‑thinking, data‑driven decision‑making, and continuous integration/continuous delivery pipelines, I champion agile, lean methodologies, stakeholder alignment, and operational excellence to accelerate disruptive, mission‑critical outcomes.
